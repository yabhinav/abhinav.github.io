### Career

**You wanna know what I do to earn my food and sleep?**

Well I am a BigData Engineer with roots in Python, Datascience, Ansible and AWS. Certified in both MapR Converged and Hortonworks Data Platforms
{: .notice}

My previous assignments involve :
 * Building Configuration Management and Orchestration tools in Ansible for kickstarting and maintaining 60+ Hortonworks Hadoop cluster with around 1600 individual nodes in total.
 * I have also worked assignments that demanded skills in NaturalLanguageProcessing(NLP), pySpark and backend Java Applications in earlier stages of my career.
